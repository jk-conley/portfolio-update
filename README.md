# Portfolio Update

First Treehouse Front End Project. This project leans into the basics of HTML and CSS. Fun as always to bring a front end design mockup into the digital space. Purpose of this project was to modify existing code and add our own to build a basic portfolio page. Can't wait to see what the next lessons and project task will be :)
